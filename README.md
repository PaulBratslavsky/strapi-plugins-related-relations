# ðŸš€ Getting started

- After running Strapi in development mode, (if the database is empty) a function named "generateDummyData" located in ./src/index.js, populates the database with dummy data.

- If you don't want to generate dummy data, comment out the generateDummyData function within the bootstrap function.

- The dummy data and the script are located in ./src/dummyData/ directory

### `develop`

```
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```
